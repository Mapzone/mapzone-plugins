# Developing plugins for mapzone.io

## Introduction

mapzone.io is an open and extendible platform for processing and publishing of geospatial data. It is based on the open source [Polymap4](https://github.com/Polymap4) project, which in turn is based on Eclipse and the [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) plugin framework. On top of this foundation mapzone.io provides an API that allows to develop plugins and run them on the platform. Plugins can extend mapzone.io in every conceivable way, like an importer for a new data format, a new map tool, a new style editor or sharelet. Plugins can be privat to a user or organization or public. Public plugins can be used by all users of mapzone.io.
