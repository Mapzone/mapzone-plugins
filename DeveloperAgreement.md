# Plugin Developer Agreement

## Pricing model, billing, termination

Just like the basic mapzone.io fee the plugin fees are billed **per members (users)** of an organization **per month**. The minimum time to use (and be billed for) a plugin is **one month**.

A user can **terminate** using a plugin at any time. The plugin is available until the end of the billing period (month). If a user needs the functions for just one month, then he/she can select and activate the plugin and deactivate right afterwards. The plugin is then billed for just one month. The plugin can be re-activated at any time.

mapzone.io charges a **transaction fee of 15%** of the plugin fee.

### Example monthly costs

In the following **examples** the basic plugin fee is: **15€**

One user with just personal private projects:
```
  + mapzone.io: 9.00€ (1 x 9€ per user)
  + plugin:    15.00€ (1 x 15€ per user)
  =            24.00€
  
    15%         3.60€ transaction fee
    85%        21.40€ payed out to developer
```

The basic mapzone.io fee (9€) is not billed if there are no private projects. However, the plugin fee is billed regardless if there are private projects or not.
